About me
======

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
I am a geodynamicist, and I develop mathematical and computational models of the Earth's interior that can help us understand how the Earth's surface has evolved. In my research, I am particularly interested in the processes that cause rocks in the Earth's deep interior to melt, the migration of the generated magma towards the Earth's surface, and how these processes are connected to the formation of oceanic islands and other forms of volcanism.

Software
------
I am one of the principal developers and maintainers of the free modeling software [ASPECT](https://aspect.geodynamics.org) (Advanced Solver for
Problems in Earth's Convection). ASPECT uses modern numerical methods to support research in simulating convection in the Earth's mantle and elsewhere.
