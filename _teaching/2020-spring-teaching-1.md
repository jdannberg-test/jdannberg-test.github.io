This course gives an overview over the structure and the motion of material in the Earth’s interior. It includes answering questions such as:
* What is plate tectonics and what causes plates to move?
* What processes lead to volcanism and where is melt present in the Earth’s interior?
* What are the major structures inside the Earth and what processes lead to the formation of these structures?
The course teach how to use tools from mathematics and physics, and in particular computer modeling, to address these questions. In addition, it discusses the constraints on these problems provided by paleomagnetism, mineral physics, seismology, volcanology, geochemistry, petrology, and other disciplines.
